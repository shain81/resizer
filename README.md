ðŸš€ Real-Time Image Resizing Using Hand Gestures | Computer Vision & OpenCV ðŸŽ¯

In the field of Computer Vision, creating intuitive and touchless interactions is an exciting challenge. I recently developed a real-time image resizing system controlled by hand gestures, leveraging OpenCV and a Hand Tracking Module.

âœ… How It Works:
Using two index fingers, the user can dynamically resize an image simply by moving their fingers closer together (zoom out) or farther apart (zoom in)â€”no touch required! The system precisely tracks hand movements and adjusts the image size accordingly in real-time.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ OpenCV (cv2) for image processing
ðŸ”¹ HandTracking Module for real-time hand and finger tracking

This project showcases the power of gesture-based control in interactive systems. It has potential applications in AR interfaces, virtual UI navigation, touchless controls, and human-computer interaction (HCI).
